## MINT Lab's Know-Where
These days the MINT lab think that _know-where_ is more important than _know-how_. _[Know-how](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know-how)_ is a term for practical knowledge on how to accomplish something. We use a new term, _know-where_, to emphasize to know where your desired information is available and organized. It is usually referred as _[awesome](https://github.com/topics/awesome)_ in Github.

The MINT lab would like to share our _know-where_ which contains useful hyperlinks for our researches and studies on _robotics_ and _computer vision_. It is an extension of [Sunglok Choi's old collections of useful links](https://sites.google.com/site/sunglok/). The topics are as follows:

* Computing
  * [Programming](programming.md)
  * [Machine Learning and Deep Learning](machine_learning.md)
* Mathematics
* Robotics
* Computer Vision
